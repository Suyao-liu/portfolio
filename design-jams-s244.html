  <section class="design-process">
    <h2><span>🧠 </span>Design Process</h2>
    <h3>🏁 1. Empathize</h3>
    <p>We defined our audience and identified common financial challenges faced by Gen Z using secondary research and created detailed personas.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>🔍 2. Competitive Analysis</h3>
    <p>We analyzed apps like Buddy, Wealthsimple, and Questrade. We noticed they offered strong visual design and automation but often overwhelmed users with complexity or lacked personalization. Our goal was to stand out by being more friendly and goal focused.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>🧭 3. Define & Ideate</h3>
    <p>We brainstormed user friendly features such as bite sized lessons, progress tracking, and gamified challenges to drive engagement.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>🧪 4. Prototype</h3>
    <p>We sketched wireframes and built a Figma prototype focused on clarity, simplicity, and visual engagement.</p>
    <div class="placeholder"><img src="images/low-fi.png" alt="persona"></div>
    <br>
    <h3>📊 5. Test & Iterate</h3>
    <p>We presented the prototype to peers and mentors, then refined navigation, layout, and copy tone based on feedback.</p>

  <section class="solution">
    <h2 class="section-title"><span>🌟 </span>Final Solution</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">
      To empower users like Maria on their financial literacy journey, we designed a 
      <strong>gamified, personalized learning app</strong> powered by trusted Sun Life resources. 
      Our final solution delivers a fun, approachable, and habit forming experience that makes 
      financial education less intimidating and more engaging.
    </p>

    <div class="solution-point">
      <h3 class="point-title">🎯 Personalized & Goal Oriented Learning</h3>
      <p>
        The app begins with a short 3 question assessment to understand Maria’s current financial knowledge. 
        Based on her responses and selected goals whether it’s saving, investing, or paying off debt 
        the app generates a <strong>customized learning path</strong> tailored to her needs.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="solution-point">
      <h3 class="point-title">🐶 Motivational Companion System</h3>
      <p>
        Maria is rewarded with points throughout her learning journey, which she uses to adopt and care for 
        a <strong>financial buddy pet</strong>. The pet grows and evolves as Maria progresses, acting as a playful 
        but powerful motivator. This emotional connection helps users stay engaged while learning at their own pace.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="solution-point">
      <h3 class="point-title">⏱️ Micro-Learning for Busy Lives</h3>
      <p>
        We emphasized <strong>accessibility and simplicity</strong> by designing 5-minute daily lessons that fit 
        easily into busy routines. Users can build streaks, earn more points, and stay consistent without 
        feeling overwhelmed.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="solution-point">
      <h3 class="point-title">🧠 Quizzes, Checklists & Reinforcement</h3>
      <p>
        Each lesson is followed by a short quiz to reinforce key concepts. The app also includes 
        <strong>interactive checklists</strong> and tasks to support real life application of new knowledge—
        making learning practical, not just theoretical.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="solution-point">
      <h3 class="point-title">🎨 Friendly, Trustworthy Interface</h3>
      <p>
        Our final UI design is clean, bright, and intuitive. From onboarding to daily lessons, every screen was 
        crafted to feel safe, fun, and empowering. Clear visual hierarchy and consistent branding enhance trust
        further supported by the app’s partnership with <strong>Sun Life</strong>.
